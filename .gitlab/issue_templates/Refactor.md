~"Type :: Refactor"

<!--- What needs to be cleaned up?  How would the refactored implementation -->
<!--- differ from what we have now?  What are the potential downsides to    -->
<!--- not dealing with the technical debt now and leaving it for later?     -->

<!--- If the refactor needs to be completed by a certain date, please       -->
<!--- assign a Due Date below.                                              -->
